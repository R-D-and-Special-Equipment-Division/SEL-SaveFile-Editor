Before proceeding, please make yourself knowledgeable of the license used by this Python program. 

-- How it works --

Three separate scripts are to be used, and have to remain in the same repository. 
The first script to be used it the script that converts the raw savefile into a JSON file.
The second script to be used is the main one, that will read the JSON file, and will print out a JSON file according to a file you have to create yourself. In short, you have to write a file, a .txt, separated by "," - that has all the chapters of the game you have completed. 

In conclusion, this serves as an editor of the savefile whereas your .txt file means you have completed each chapter appearing in this txt file, and thus, can edit the savefile.
